        Antivirus is an animation project I have been working on for a little while now. It follows Stax, a tax collector who gets caught in chaos to collect a mysterious man's taxes. This man is Mr. MAL, a walking computer virus with the intent to take Stax's soul to use as a fuel for more viruses to come. Will Stax escape the man, soul intact, or will he be yet another victim to Mr. MAL's malicious plot? Who is the III, and will Overlord be caught in the deep web of the situation? All this and more in Antivirus! This is part 1 and 2 of a 3 part series. When all 3 are finished, I will combine them to make a 5-7 minute short film. Hope you enjoy the animation, and stick around for more Antivirus content!
