        Hi, my name is Dippy, and I love art and video games. I think I've been drawing as long as I can remember. Of course, the old ones would look bad, but I really got good when I tried digital art. It was really helpful and good, and I still use it to this day! My introduction to gaming was my Nintendo Switch. The first real game I got into was Fortnite. But it was when I started playing games like Undertale and Portal that made me want to make games. After a couple failed attempts, I created Expressaria. It has gone through a lot of changes, but I think the story so far is going excellent! For more about Expressaria and more, there is a Franchise Tab coming soon. Just now I am starting to code, and I like it! I feel like my little story that started from nothing is now finally becoming something! Feel free to wander around the site, I spent loads of time making it.
